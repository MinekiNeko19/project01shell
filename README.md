# [insert name here] Shell
Group Members: Sarah Leong, Yuqing Wu

**Our shell implements:**
- commands stored in /bin
- cd
- exit
- piping using |
- redirection using >,<,>>,<<

**Eek! Bugs!!**\n
[ ] Cd may print an error even after properly moving directories
[ ] putting extra spaces at the end of a line will break the shell
[ ] can't do redirection <,>,<<,>> in the same line

**WIP**\n
[ ] signal handling
_Optional_
[ ] piping multiple times in one line
[ ] unrestricted ordering and locations of > and <
[ ] colored shell prompting
