# Shellos Shell
Group Members: Sarah Leong, Yuqing Wu

**Our shell implements:**
- commands stored in /bin
- cd
- exit
- piping using |
- redirection using >,<,>>,<<
- ; Usage: [command 1] ; [command 2]

**Eek! Bugs!!**
- [X] putting extra spaces at the end of a line will break the shell
- [ ] crashes when doing "||"

**WIP**
- [ ] signal handling

_Optional_
- [ ] piping multiple times in one line
- [ ] unrestricted ordering and locations of redirection
- [X] colored shell prompting
- [ ] unlimited # inputted args
